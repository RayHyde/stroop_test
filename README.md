<h1>Take a Stroop Test online</h1>

<p>In psychology, the Stroop effect demonstrates the interference in the reaction time of a task. When a word such as blue, green, red, etc. is shown in a colour differing from the colour what the word actually says (i.e. the word “<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">red</span>” shown in blue letters), a delay occurs in our brain in the processing of the word's actual colour, leading to slower test reaction times and an increase in mistakes. The effect is named after its discoverer, John Ridley Stroop in 1935. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect">See Wikipedia</a></p>

<h2>My Playground</h2>
<h3>Not <em>another</em> Stroop test?</h3>
<p>There are so many ugly, incomprehensible or broken Stroop tests out there on the Net, I felt it was my civic duty to make a clean and fast one in jQuery.</p>

<p>This project is part of my Playground - a collection of fun (and dare I say it: clever) stuff I made in the past, from jQuery games and plugins to CSS animation tricks.</p>
